# C++ PLP

PLP1

Welcome to My Repository
In this repository, I will be coding in C++.

About C++
History: C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an enhancement to C, originally called "C with Objects." It was officially named C++ in 1983.

Applications: C++ is widely used in system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing, and high-performance applications.

Transitioning from Python: As someone familiar with Python, I find it helpful to compare equivalent code in both languages to understand C++'s advantages and limitations. I plan to explore Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ book as well.

Resources
Python to C++ Code Converter: CodeConvert
Codecademy
Installation and Environment
Installing C++: I followed this YouTube tutorial for installation.

Programming Environment: Iâ€™m using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for C++ development. I find it convenient for compiling, as I've used it for other languages before.

Running Programs: In C++, comments are written using //. In Python, comments are made with #.

This Week's Focus: C++ Data Types and Operations
Primary Data Types
C++ has several primary data types, including:

Integer
Character
Boolean
Floating Point
Double
Void (Valueless)
Wide Character
Additionally, C++ supports complex data types like:

Pointers
References
Enumerations
Classes
Dictionaries
Reserved Words
C++ has about 48 reserved keywords (e.g., class, const, for, do, short, long) that cannot be used as identifiers.

Interesting Facts about C++ Operations
Arithmetic operations can be performed on various data types (integers, floats, etc.).
Identifiers should follow the format: firstWord (first word in lowercase, subsequent words capitalized, no underscores).
Adding floats and doubles defaults to double type.
When dividing two integers, the result is truncated to an integer (e.g., 1/3 results in 0).
Dividing an integer by a float yields a float.
Character arithmetic uses ASCII values (e.g., char c = 'a'; c + 5 results in 102).
Syntax for Characters and Strings
Characters: Enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'a').
Strings: Enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello").
Understanding Void and Wide Characters
Void: Indicates no return value expected in functions.
Wide Characters: Used for larger character sets in different languages.
Boolean Values
In C++, boolean values are represented as 0 (false) and 1 (true). The keywords true and false correspond to these values.

Language Characteristics
Statically or Dynamically Typed?: C++ is statically typed, with variable types checked at compile time, allowing early bug detection.

Strongly or Weakly Typed?: C++ is strongly typed, requiring explicit type declarations for variables.

Explicitly or Implicitly Typed?: C++ is explicitly typed, requiring the type to be declared for each variable.

Mutable or Immutable?: Objects are mutable by default, but can be made immutable with the const keyword.

Limitations of C++
Integer size is typically 4 bytes, which can be restrictive for large numbers.
You cannot directly mix data types (e.g., adding integers or floats to characters).
Lists (arrays) and dictionaries (maps) store only one data type at a time and require iteration for printing.
