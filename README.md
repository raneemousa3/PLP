Welcome to my Repository;

Here: I will be coding in C++
1- C++

2- C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Since C++ is an attempt to add object-oriented features (plus other improvements) to C, it was called C with Objects. As the language developed, Stroustrup named it as C++ in 1983.

3- it's Used in system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance applications. 

4-I’m used to coding in Python so a helpful thing for me would be seeing the same code for python and c++ side by side and comparing C++ advantages and limitations  to python, I will also try to get my hands on the c++ book by Bjarne Stroustrup 

I’m planning to make use of these sources : https://www.codeconvert.ai/python-to-c++-converter and code academy

1.What did you need to do to install the language?I followed this video to install c++:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw5qjRNlC-Y
2. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not,
how did you pick the one that you'll be using?I’m using VS code to code in c++, I used vs code to code in other languages and I find it very convenient for compiling
3. How do you run programs in that language?To write comments in c++, use double backslash //
4. How do you write comments in your language? in python, I used #
